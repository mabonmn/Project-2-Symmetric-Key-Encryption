CS 5158/6058 Data Security and Privacy, Fall 2023
Project 2: Symmetric-Key Encryption
Instructor: Dr. Boyang Wang
Due Date: 10/6/2023 (Friday), 11:59pm.
Format: Please submit a zip file of your code in Canvas.
Total Points: 5 points
Note: This is an individual project.
1 Project Description
In this project, you will need to implement a symmetric-key encryption scheme using AES. More
specifically,
– For the key generation function, you program should be able to output a secret key sk of AES, and
write this secret key to a file. The length of your key should be 256 bits and the encryption mode is
Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).
– For the encryption function, given a data file f , your program should be able to read a secret key sk,
encrypt data file with secret key k, and encrypt this file with this key using AES.
c ← AES.Enck(f )
– For the decryption function, given an encrypted data file c and a secret key sk, your program should
be able to decrypt this encrypted data file, and write the result of this decryption to a file.
f ← AES.Deck(c)
2 Basic Requirements
Programming Language: You can use either C/C++, Python or Java. If you choose to use
C/C++, CMake is recommended (but not required). You can choose any IDE you like, the code you
submit should be able to compile and run in Linux or Windows.
Crypto Libraries: You can leverage third-party libraries, such as openssl (C/C++), pycrypto
(Python), BouncyCastle (Java), etc., to implement AES encryption. You do not need to build the
functions of AES by yourself.
Program Directory: Please name your project folder in the form of aes m123456, where aes is the
name of this project and m123456 is your UCID. The recommended directories of your program should be
organized as follows:
./ aes_m123456 / src
./ aes_m123456 / build
./ aes_m123456 / data
./ aes_m123456 / report . pdf
Normally, folder src should include all the source files and your own header files, e.g., .cpp and .h files.
All the object files and executable files, e.g., .o files, should be under folder build. Folder data has all the
given files and data, and also includes all the files and results generated by the program. In report.pdf
file, you should describe which OS you use, show which language and version you use, and illustrate how to
compile, run and use your code. In addition, you also need to include screenshots for the outputs
of each function in your report (please see details in the next section).

3 Project Details
For AES encryption, you should choose AES-CBC-256. A plaintext file is stored
in “../data/plaintext.txt”. And the plaintext in this file is
Welcome to data security and privacy 2023.
1. Key Generation Function:
(a) Generate a secret key using AES, print this secret key in terminal, and write this secret key sk to file
“../data/key.txt”. The key needs to be printed and written in hexadecimal (i.e., based 16).
(b) Take a screenshot for the output of your key generation function in step (a) and include it in your
report.
2. Encryption Function:
(a) Read a secret key sk from file “../data/key.txt”, and read a plaintext file f from
file “../data/plaintext.txt”;
(b) Generate a random initialization vector iv, encrypt plaintext file f with secret key k and initialization
vector iv, and write its ciphertext c to file “../data/ciphertext.txt” in hexadecimal. This random
initialization vector is stored in file “../data/iv.txt” in hexadecimal.
(c) Your encryption function should be able to encrypt any plaintext file using this encryption function.
(d) Take a screenshot for the output of your encryption function in step (b) and include it in your report.
3. Decryption Function:
(a) Read a secret key sk from file “../data/key.txt”, an initialization vector iv from
file “../data/iv.txt”, and a ciphertext file c from file “../data/ciphertext.txt”;
(b) Output a plaintext file f by decrypting c with secret key k, and write this result of this decryption to
file “../data/result.txt”. The decryption result should be written in (human-readable) string, not
in hexadecimal, and it should be the same as the original plaintext in “../data/plaintext.txt” if
you decrypt correctly.
(c) Take a screenshot for the output of your decryption function in step (b) and include it in your report.
4. (CS6058 Only) Different Encryption Modes:
(a) Given plaintext file f from file “../data/plaintext.txt”, encrypt this plaintext file in two modes, one
in Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode and one in CBC mode, with a same secret key. Run your encryption
5 times with each mode, compare your result and explain the difference between the ciphertexts of those
two methods. You should have a function in your project to output ciphertexts with a same key but
using those two different modes.
(b) Take a screenshot for the output of this comparison in step (a) and include it in your report.
(c) You also need to test the average encryption time and decryption time of CBC mode using the given
file, and include those results in your report.
4 Evaluation
Your project will be evaluated in three aspects.

1. Correctness of Functions (70%): Your program should be able to correctly run all the functions
described in this project. If for some reason, your code cannot be compiled but the logic of your code
is correct, you will still get partial credits.
2. Comments (10%): Write comments and briefly explain each function in your code, such as inputs,
outputs, etc. You may need some of the functions in other projects. Detailed comments on each function
can save your time in other projects.
3. Report (20%): Please clearly explain how to compile and run your code in report.pdf. Please include
clear description regarding how you complete the project and clear screenshots for each function.
5 Examples
This section provides some examples, which can help you understand the functions of your project. If
your code can provide the same functionalities, you can customize the number of arguments and the order
of arguments, as long as you describe it clearly in your report.
Example 1: The following command calls the key generation function
aes keygen ../ data / key . txt
where aes is the name of your executable file, keygen is the argument for key generation function,
../data/key.txt is the secret key file. Note that, depending on where your executable file is and your
OS, the paths of your input and output files might be different. Security parameter λ = 256 is default and
pre-defined in your program.
Example 2: The following command calls the encryption function
aes enc ../ data / key . txt ../ data / plaintext . txt
../ data / ciphertext . txt
where ../data/plaintext.txt is the plaintext file, and the ciphertext c will be written to
file ../data/ciphertext.txt. By default, an initialization vector iv is stored in file ../data/iv.txt.
Example 3: The following command calls the decryption function
aes dec ../ data / key . txt ../ data / ciphertext . txt
../ data / result . txt
where the decryption of a ciphertext will be written to file ../data/result.txt
